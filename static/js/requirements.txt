I'm sorry, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The file "requirements.txt" is not located in the "js" directory. It's usually located in the root directory of a Python project. Also, it's not a JavaScript file. It's a text file that lists the Python packages required for the project. 

If you want to see the content of "requirements.txt", please use the correct path. If you want to see a JavaScript file, please provide the correct file name.
